371. REST APIs & The Rest Of The Course
    ? How do we adjust our knowlegde working with a Rest API instead of a view based application?

    Let's Organize all main topics we learnt (in the left as we learnt, in the right differences for Rest APIs):

        - NODE + Express App Setup      |       No Changes
        - Routing / Endpoints      |       Just more http methods
        - Handling Req & Res      |       Parse + Send JSON files (instead of views)
        - Request Validation      |       No Changes
        - DataBase Communication      |       No Changes
        - Files Uploads & Downloads      |       No real changes (Only in the client side)
        - Sessions & Cookies      |       There is no more
        - Authentication      |       A Different Authentication Approach

    - No real changes, just more http methods

    - Work with JSON data instead of Views
