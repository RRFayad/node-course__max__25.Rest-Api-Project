371. REST APIs & The Rest Of The Course
    ? How do we adjust our knowlegde working with a Rest API instead of a view based application?

    Let's Organize all main topics we learnt (in the left as we learnt, in the right differences for Rest APIs):

        - NODE + Express App Setup      |       No Changes
        - Routing / Endpoints      |       Just more http methods
        - Handling Req & Res      |       Parse + Send JSON files (instead of views)
        - Request Validation      |       No Changes
        - DataBase Communication      |       No Changes
        - Files Uploads & Downloads      |       No real changes (Only in the client side)
        - Sessions & Cookies      |       There is no more
        - Authentication      |       A Different Authentication Approach

    - No real changes, just more http methods

    - Work with JSON data instead of Views

373. Planning the API
    - Summing up,. we just had a look at the files in th ereact app that we will need to fetch some data from the API

    * We just set the URL in the frontend, and set some parameters in the backend controller

375. Adding a Create Post Endpoint
    * We set some parameters to the end point, in the server and in the front end code
